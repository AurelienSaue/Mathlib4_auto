`restate_axiom` takes a structure field, and makes a new, definitionally simplified copy of it.
If the existing field name ends with a `'`, the new field just has the prime removed. Otherwise,
we append `_lemma`.
The main application is to provide clean versions of structure fields that have been tagged with
an auto_param.

`restate_axiom` makes a new copy of a structure field, first definitionally simplifying the type.
This is useful to remove `auto_param` or `opt_param` from the statement.

As an example, we have:
```lean
structure A :=
(x : â„•)
(a' : x = 1 . skip)

example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.a' -- rewrite tactic failed, lemma is not an equality nor a iff

restate_axiom A.a'
example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.a
```

By default, `restate_axiom` names the new lemma by removing a trailing `'`, or otherwise appending
`_lemma` if there is no trailing `'`. You can also give `restate_axiom` a second argument to
specify the new name, as in
```lean
restate_axiom A.a f
example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.f
```
