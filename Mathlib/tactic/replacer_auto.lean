# `def_replacer`

A mechanism for defining tactics for use in auto params, whose
meaning is defined incrementally through attributes.

/-- Define a new replaceable tactic. -/
/--
`def_replacer foo` sets up a stub definition `foo : tactic unit`, which can
effectively be defined and re-defined later, by tagging definitions with `@[foo]`.

- `@[foo] meta def foo_1 : tactic unit := ...` replaces the current definition of `foo`.
- `@[foo] meta def foo_2 (old : tactic unit) : tactic unit := ...` replaces the current
  definition of `foo`, and provides access to the previous definition via `old`.
  (The argument can also be an `option (tactic unit)`, which is provided as `none` if
  this is the first definition tagged with `@[foo]` since `def_replacer` was invoked.)

`def_replacer foo : α → β → tactic γ` allows the specification of a replacer with
custom input and output types. In this case all subsequent redefinitions must have the
same type, or the type `α → β → tactic γ → tactic γ` or
`α → β → option (tactic γ) → tactic γ` analogously to the previous cases.
