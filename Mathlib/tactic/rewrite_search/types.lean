A `how` contains information needed by the explainer to generate code for a rewrite.
`rule_index` denotes which rule in the static list of rules is used.
`location` describes which match of that rule was used, to work with `nth_rewrite`.
`addr` is a list of "left" and "right" describing which subexpression is rewritten.

/-- Convert a `how` to a human-readable string. -/
/-- `rewrite` represents a single step of rewriting, that proves `exp` using `proof`. -/
/--
`proof_unit` represents a sequence of steps that can be applied to one side of the
equation to prove a particular expression.

Configuration options for a rewrite search.
`max_iterations` controls how many vertices are expanded in the graph search.
`explain` generates Lean code to replace the call to `rewrite_search`.
`explain_using_conv` changes the nature of the explanation.
