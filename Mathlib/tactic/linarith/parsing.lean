# Parsing input expressions into linear form

`linarith` computes the linear form of its input expressions,
assuming (without justification) that the type of these expressions
is a commutative semiring.
It identifies atoms up to ring-equivalence: that is, `(y*3)*x` will be identified `3*(x*y)`,
where the monomial `x*y` is the linear atom.

* Variables are represented by natural numbers.
* Monomials are represented by `monom := rb_map ℕ ℕ`. The monomial `1` is represented by the empty map.
* Linear combinations of monomials are represented by `sum := rb_map monom ℤ`.

All input expressions are converted to `sum`s, preserving the map from expressions to variables.
We then discard the monomial information, mapping each distinct monomial to a natural number.
The resulting `rb_map ℕ ℤ` represents the ring-normalized linear form of the expression.
This is ultimately converted into a `linexp` in the obvious way.

`linear_forms_and_vars` is the main entry point into this file. Everything else is contained.
