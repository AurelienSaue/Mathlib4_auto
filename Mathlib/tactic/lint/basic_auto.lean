# Basic linter types and attributes

This file defines the basic types and attributes used by the linting
framework.  A linter essentially consists of a function
`declaration â†’ tactic (option string)`, this function together with some
metadata is stored in the `linter` structure. We define two attributes:

 * `@[linter]` applies to a declaration of type `linter` and adds it to the default linter set.

 * `@[nolint linter_name]` omits the tagged declaration from being checked by
   the linter with name `linter_name`.
-/

/--
We store the list of nolint names as `@id (list name) (Prop simp_nf doc_blame has_coe_t)`

See Note [user attribute parameters]
-/
/-- Defines the user attribute `nolint` for skipping `#lint` -/
/-- `should_be_linted linter decl` returns true if `decl` should be checked
using `linter`, i.e., if there is no `nolint` attribute. -/
/--
A linting test for the `#lint` command.

`test` defines a test to perform on every declaration. It should never fail. Returning `none`
signifies a passing test. Returning `some msg` reports a failing test with error `msg`.

`no_errors_found` is the message printed when all tests are negative, and `errors_found` is printed
when at least one test is positive.

If `is_fast` is false, this test will be omitted from `#lint-`.

If `auto_decls` is true, this test will also be executed on automatically generated declarations.
-/
/-- Takes a list of names that resolve to declarations of type `linter`,
and produces a list of linters. -/
/-- Defines the user attribute `linter` for adding a linter to the default set.
Linters should be defined in the `linter` namespace.
A linter `linter.my_new_linter` is referred to as `my_new_linter` (without the `linter` namespace)
when used in `#lint`.
