# Constructing binary product from pullbacks and terminal object.

If a category has pullbacks and a terminal object, then it has binary products.

TODO: provide the dual result.

/-- Any category with pullbacks and terminal object has binary products. -/
-- This is not an instance, as it is not always how one wants to construct binary products!
