/-- Create a rsimp attribute named `attr_name`, the attribute declaration is named `attr_decl_name`.
    The cached hinst_lemmas structure is built using the lemmas marked with simp attribute `simp_attr_name`,
    but *not* marked with `ex_attr_name`.

    We say `ex_attr_name` is the "exception set". It is useful for excluding lemmas in `simp_attr_name`
    which are not good or redundant for ematching. -/
/- The following lemmas are not needed by rsimp, and they actually hurt performance since they generate a lot of
   instances. -/
