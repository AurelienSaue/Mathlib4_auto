# Uniform spaces

Uniform spaces are a generalization of metric spaces and topological groups. Many concepts directly
generalize to uniform spaces, e.g.

* uniform continuity (in this file)
* completeness (in `cauchy.lean`)
* extension of uniform continuous functions to complete spaces (in `uniform_embedding.lean`)
* totally bounded sets (in `cauchy.lean`)
* totally bounded complete sets are compact (in `cauchy.lean`)

A uniform structure on a type `X` is a filter `𝓤 X` on `X × X` satisfying some conditions
which makes it reasonable to say that `∀ᶠ (p : X × X) in 𝓤 X, ...` means
"for all p.1 and p.2 in X close enough, ...". Elements of this filter are called entourages
of `X`. The two main examples are:

* If `X` is a metric space, `V ∈ 𝓤 X ↔ ∃ ε > 0, { p | dist p.1 p.2 < ε } ⊆ V`
* If `G` is an additive topological group, `V ∈ 𝓤 G ↔ ∃ U ∈ 𝓝 (0 : G), {p | p.2 - p.1 ∈ U} ⊆ V`

Those examples are generalizations in two different directions of the elementary example where
`X = ℝ` and `V ∈ 𝓤 ℝ ↔ ∃ ε > 0, { p | |p.2 - p.1| < ε } ⊆ V` which features both the topological
group structure on `ℝ` and its metric space structure.

Each uniform structure on `X` induces a topology on `X` characterized by

> `nhds_eq_comap_uniformity : ∀ {x : X}, 𝓝 x = comap (prod.mk x) (𝓤 X)`

where `prod.mk x : X → X × X := (λ y, (x, y))` is the partial evaluation of the product
constructor.

The dictionary with metric spaces includes:
* an upper bound for `dist x y` translates into `(x, y) ∈ V` for some `V ∈ 𝓤 X`
* a ball `ball x r` roughly corresponds to `uniform_space.ball x V := {y | (x, y) ∈ V}`
  for some `V ∈ 𝓤 X`, but the later is more general (it includes in
  particular both open and closed balls for suitable `V`).
  In particular we have:
  `is_open_iff_ball_subset {s : set X} : is_open s ↔ ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ V ∈ 𝓤 X, ball x V ⊆ s`

The triangle inequality is abstracted to a statement involving the composition of relations in `X`.
First note that the triangle inequality in a metric space is equivalent to
`∀ (x y z : X) (r r' : ℝ), dist x y ≤ r → dist y z ≤ r' → dist x z ≤ r + r'`.
Then, for any `V` and `W` with type `set (X × X)`, the composition `V ○ W : set (X × X)` is
defined as `{ p : X × X | ∃ z, (p.1, z) ∈ V ∧ (z, p.2) ∈ W }`.
In the metric space case, if `V = { p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r }` and `W = { p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r' }`
then the triangle inequality, as reformulated above, says `V ○ W` is contained in
`{p | dist p.1 p.2 ≤ r + r'}` which is the entourage associated to the radius `r + r'`.
In general we have `mem_ball_comp (h : y ∈ ball x V) (h' : z ∈ ball y W) : z ∈ ball x (V ○ W)`.
Note that this discussion does not depend on any axiom imposed on the uniformity filter,
it is simply captured by the definition of composition.

The uniform space axioms ask the filter `𝓤 X` to satisfy the following:
* every `V ∈ 𝓤 X` contains the diagonal `id_rel = { p | p.1 = p.2 }`. This abstracts the fact
  that `dist x x ≤ r` for every non-negative radius `r` in the metric space case and also that
  `x - x` belongs to every neighborhood of zero in the topological group case.
* `V ∈ 𝓤 X → prod.swap '' V ∈ 𝓤 X`. This is tightly related the fact that `dist x y = dist y x`
  in a metric space, and to continuity of negation in the topological group case.
* `∀ V ∈ 𝓤 X, ∃ W ∈ 𝓤 X, W ○ W ⊆ V`. In the metric space case, it corresponds
  to cutting the radius of a ball in half and applying the triangle inequality.
  In the topological group case, it comes from continuity of addition at `(0, 0)`.

These three axioms are stated more abstractly in the definition below, in terms of
operations on filters, without directly manipulating entourages.

## Main definitions

* `uniform_space X` is a uniform space structure on a type `X`
* `uniform_continuous f` is a predicate saying a function `f : α → β` between uniform spaces
  is uniformly continuous : `∀ r ∈ 𝓤 β, ∀ᶠ (x : α × α) in 𝓤 α, (f x.1, f x.2) ∈ r`

In this file we also define a complete lattice structure on the type `uniform_space X`
of uniform structures on `X`, as well as the pullback (`uniform_space.comap`) of uniform structures
coming from the pullback of filters.
Like distance functions, uniform structures cannot be pushed forward in general.

## Notations

Localized in `uniformity`, we have the notation `𝓤 X` for the uniformity on a uniform space `X`,
and `○` for composition of relations, seen as terms with type `set (X × X)`.

## Implementation notes

There is already a theory of relations in `data/rel.lean` where the main definition is
`def rel (α β : Type*) := α → β → Prop`.
The relations used in the current file involve only one type, but this is not the reason why
we don't reuse `data/rel.lean`. We use `set (α × α)`
instead of `rel α α` because we really need sets to use the filter library, and elements
of filters on `α × α` have type `set (α × α)`.

The structure `uniform_space X` bundles a uniform structure on `X`, a topology on `X` and
an assumption saying those are compatible. This may not seem mathematically reasonable at first,
but is in fact an instance of the forgetful inheritance pattern. See Note [forgetful inheritance]
below.

## References

The formalization uses the books:

* [N. Bourbaki, *General Topology*][bourbaki1966]
* [I. M. James, *Topologies and Uniformities*][james1999]

But it makes a more systematic use of the filter library.

/-- Suppose that one can put two mathematical structures on a type, a rich one `R` and a poor one
`P`, and that one can deduce the poor structure from the rich structure through a map `F` (called a
forgetful functor) (think `R = metric_space` and `P = topological_space`). A possible
implementation would be to have a type class `rich` containing a field `R`, a type class `poor`
containing a field `P`, and an instance from `rich` to `poor`. However, this creates diamond
problems, and a better approach is to let `rich` extend `poor` and have a field saying that
`F R = P`.

To illustrate this, consider the pair `metric_space` / `topological_space`. Consider the topology
on a product of two metric spaces. With the first approach, it could be obtained by going first from
each metric space to its topology, and then taking the product topology. But it could also be
obtained by considering the product metric space (with its sup distance) and then the topology
coming from this distance. These would be the same topology, but not definitionally, which means
that from the point of view of Lean's kernel, there would be two different `topological_space`
instances on the product. This is not compatible with the way instances are designed and used:
there should be at most one instance of a kind on each type. This approach has created an instance
diamond that does not commute definitionally.

The second approach solves this issue. Now, a metric space contains both a distance, a topology, and
a proof that the topology coincides with the one coming from the distance. When one defines the
product of two metric spaces, one uses the sup distance and the product topology, and one has to
give the proof that the sup distance induces the product topology. Following both sides of the
instance diamond then gives rise (definitionally) to the product topology on the product space.

Another approach would be to have the rich type class take the poor type class as an instance
parameter. It would solve the diamond problem, but it would lead to a blow up of the number
of type classes one would need to declare to work with complicated classes, say a real inner
product space, and would create exponential complexity when working with products of
such complicated spaces, that are avoided by bundling things carefully as above.

Note that this description of this specific case of the product of metric spaces is oversimplified
compared to mathlib, as there is an intermediate typeclass between `metric_space` and
`topological_space` called `uniform_space`. The above scheme is used at both levels, embedding a
topology in the uniform space structure, and a uniform structure in the metric space structure.

Note also that, when `P` is a proposition, there is no such issue as any two proofs of `P` are
definitionally equivalent in Lean.

To avoid boilerplate, there are some designs that can automatically fill the poor fields when
creating a rich structure if one doesn't want to do something special about them. For instance,
in the definition of metric spaces, default tactics fill the uniform space fields if they are
not given explicitly. One can also have a helper function creating the rich structure from a
structure with less fields, where the helper function fills the remaining fields. See for instance
`uniform_space.of_core` or `real_inner_product.of_core`.

/-- A uniform space is a generalization of the "uniform" topological aspects of a
  metric space. It consists of a filter on `α × α` called the "uniformity", which
  satisfies properties analogous to the reflexivity, symmetry, and triangle properties
  of a metric.

### Expressing continuity properties in uniform spaces

We reformulate the various continuity properties of functions taking values in a uniform space
in terms of the uniformity in the target. Since the same lemmas (essentially with the same names)
also exist for metric spaces and emetric spaces (reformulating things in terms of the distance or
the edistance in the target), we put them in a namespace `uniform` here.

In the metric and emetric space setting, there are also similar lemmas where one assumes that
both the source and the target are metric spaces, reformulating things in terms of the distance
on both sides. These lemmas are generally written without primes, and the versions where only
the target is a metric space is primed. We follow the same convention here, thus giving lemmas
with primes.
