# The category of Profinite Types

We construct the category of profinite topological spaces,
often called profinite sets -- perhaps they could be called
profinite types in Lean.

The type of profinite topological spaces is called `Profinite`. It has a category
instance and is a fully faithful subcategory of `Top`. The fully faithful functor
is called `Profinite_to_Top`.

## Implementation notes

A profinite type is defined to be a topological space which is
compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected.

## TODO

0. Link to category of projective limits of finite discrete sets.
1. existence of products, limits(?), finite coproducts
2. `Profinite_to_Top` creates limits?
3. Clausen/Scholze topology on the category `Profinite`.
